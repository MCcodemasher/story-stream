    <p class="font-weight-bold" style="color:white">
        The galaxy is at a period of a civil war. Rebel spies have stolen plans to the Galactic Empire's Death Star, a
        moon-sized space station capable of destroying an entire planet. Princess Leia, secretly one of the Rebellion's
        leaders, has obtained its schematics, but her starship is captured by an Imperial Star Destroyer under the
        command of the ruthless Sith Lord Darth Vader. Before she is captured, Leia hides the plans in the memory of
        astromech droid R2-D2, who, along with protocol droid C-3PO, flees in an escape pod to the desert planet
        Tatooine.
    </p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold" style="color:white">
        The droids are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew
        Luke Skywalker. While cleaning R2-D2, Luke accidentally triggers part of a holographic recording of Leia, in
        which she requests help from Obi-Wan Kenobi. The only Kenobi Luke knows is “Old Ben” Kenobi, an elderly hermit.
        He asks his uncle if he knows anything, but his uncle rudely drops the subject. The next morning, Luke finds
        R2-D2 missing, and while searching for him, encounters Old Ben. Ben, who reveals his true name to be Obi-Wan,
        tells Luke of his days as one of the Jedi Knights, former peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who derived
        their power from an energy field called the Force until they were wiped out by the Galactic Empire. Contrary to
        what his uncle has told him, Luke learns that his father fought alongside Obi-Wan as a Jedi Knight until Vader,
        a former pupil of Obi-Wan's, turned to the dark side of the Force and murdered him. Obi-Wan presents Luke with
        his father's old weapon, a lightsaber.

            had been drawn into a trap at Endor, but adjusted, with his fleet buying valuable time for the attack to
            succeed. After the Battle of Endor, Ackbar became a Grand Admiral in the New Republic, winning many
            victories including the pivotal Battle of Jakku. He retired to Mon Cala, but was coaxed back into service
            with the Resistance by Leia Organa.</p>

                greatest leaders, fearless on the battlefield and dedicated to ending the tyranny of the Empire.
                Daughter of Padmé Amidala and Anakin Skywalker, sister of

                leaders,
                she struck out on her own to oppose the First Order as founder of the Resistance. These setbacks in her
                political career have been accompanied by more personal losses.</p>
